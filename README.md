# Classroom Access Hub Initiative Landing Page (ACE)

This repository hosts the public-facing landing page for the **Classroom Access Hub** funding initiative.

## ðŸŒŸ Mission Statement

To bridge the accessibility gap for middle school students with dyslexia in firewalled public school environments. This initiative seeks funding to deploy a secure, local server infrastructure, allowing students safe and compliant access to the **Adaptive Content Engine (ACE)**â€”an AI tool developed by a public school Reading Specialist to create highly engaging, dyslexia-optimized learning materials.

## The Core Problem

External web services, particularly AI APIs, are currently blocked by district firewalls, preventing students from accessing crucial adaptive learning technologies. This local hub is the secure, approved gateway required to deliver the ACE directly into the classroom environment.

## Key Goals

* **Security & Compliance:** Ensure all content delivery is FERPA/CIPA compliant.
* **Accessibility:** Provide immediate, reliable access to the ACE for fluency practice and data collection (via Reading Progress/Schoology).
* **Engagement:** Use AI to transform "boring" academic texts into highly motivational, gamified content formats.
